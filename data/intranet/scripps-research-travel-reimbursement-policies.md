Start by reviewing our Travel Reimbursement Best Practices Guide and Updated Travel Policies (4/2019)
REIMBURSEMENT PROTOCOL:

everyone use Expensify to prepare reimbursement requests
categorize expenses according to Transportation, Lodging, Meals, Registration fees, Mileage, and Other
when finalizing report, use these display options: Layouts = “Breakdown by Group”, Group by = “Category”
submit the finalized PDF to Andrea

electronic version by email
original receipts turned in
attach trip justification (conference agenda, etc.)
PI approval of travel (email or Slack screen shot)


Make note if any personal days before or after the conference were taken. If personal days are taken, a sample airfare (comparison/quote) must be provided for the conference dates. Print this out prior to your departure. 
FYI: The travel advance account can be used for expenses incurred prior to traveling such as airfare, hotel, and registration. This is strictly an advance and if your travel is cancelled, the funds still need to be paid back to TSRI. Please be aware of Cancellation Policies (Hotel, conference, etc). Ask Andrea for more info.


REIMBURSABLE ITEMS:

Train, taxi, shuttle, rental car, gas, parking, tolls
Lodging – Note, TSRI requires an itemized invoice for hotel 
Wifi, baggage fees, seat selection, posters
Meals (room service or meals signed back to room number) 
Registration fee 

Types of expenses that are not reimbursable include:

alcohol
trip cancellation plan 
laundry & valet service
entertainment or leisure expenses

SPECIAL NOTE ON MEALS:

There’s a “reasonability” factor to approving these costs. We don’t use a Per Diem rate and there are no strict dollar amounts to go by, but the costs incurred during meals should still remain within an appropriate range for the individual that is travelling. There are extenuating circumstances that may contribute to an increased dinner expense, or if the traveler is only requesting reimbursement for one meal that day, then I can see how a more expensive meal may be allowable. It is also important to include a description of the dinner and the business conducted if the NIH grant is paying for multiple people and their meals.
On your first day of travel and if you are flying, meals can be reimbursed only at the airport. For example, if your flight is Thursday at 8am, you cannot be reimbursed for a breakfast burrito you bought on Wednesday even if you plan to consume it on Thursday.


FOREIGN TRAVEL Note that Canada & Puerto Rico are NOT considered Foreign Travel

Domestic Airlines must be used when leaving and entering the U.S.
For travel outside the U.S., Export Control compliance laws will be required. Let your admin know and they will contact OPERA for next steps.
Please try to use your credit card for purchases as much as possible as your statement will already have converted the currency and makes the reimbursement process more precise. 


RECEIPT REQUIREMENTS

Missing receipts – please note what the receipt is for & why it’s missing (i.e. lost, forgot to ask, etc)
In some cases, you will be asked to submit a credit card or bank statement to show proof of payment

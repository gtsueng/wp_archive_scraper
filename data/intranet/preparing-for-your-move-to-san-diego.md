Information on housing
Be sure to research housing prior to your move to avoid issues later on. Don’t just look at the number of stars on yelp, but actually read the reviews analytically. For example, these reviews show very different experiences with the maintenance staff (great) vs the leasing/administration staff (poor) for the rental complex.
